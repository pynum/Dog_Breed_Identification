## About the Project

Do you ever wonder what breed that adorable dog you just met is? Our Dog Breed Identification project can help you with that! We've trained a powerful machine learning model using a vast dataset of dog images to recognize and classify dog breeds. This project showcases the beauty of AI and computer vision in action.

Key features:
- Accurate dog breed classification
- Easy-to-use web interface for breed identification
- Educational and fun for dog enthusiasts and techies alike

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get started with Dog Breed Identification:

## Data

Our model was trained on a diverse dataset of dog images,Stanford Dog Breed Identification Datatset, including a wide variety of breeds with a total of 120 breed. The dataset used can be found here:(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset)).

## Usage

1. Upload an image of a dog.
2. Click the "Identify Breed" button.
3. Let the magic happen! Our model will predict the breed of the dog in the image.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community! Whether it's improving the model's accuracy, enhancing the web interface, or adding more dog breeds to the dataset, your contributions are valuable.
